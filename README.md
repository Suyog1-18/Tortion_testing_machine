# 🔩 Torsion Testing Machine Project

This project focuses on analyzing the torsional behavior of mechanical components under applied torque. It includes calculations, visualizations, and insights into material properties like shear stress, angle of twist, and modulus of rigidity.

## 📌 Objective

To experimentally and analytically study the torsion of circular shafts and verify theoretical relationships between torque, shear stress, and angle of twist.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab
- Excel (for data collection and initial analysis)
- Mechanical Lab setup for torsion testing

## 📊 Features

- Data collection from torsion testing machine  
- Shear stress vs. angle of twist plotting  
- Calculation of:
  - Polar moment of inertia
  - Modulus of rigidity (G)
  - Shear strain
- Comparative analysis of materials (e.g., aluminum vs. steel)

## 📝 Methodology

1. Collected torque and angle of twist data from lab experiments.
2. Used theoretical formulas:
   - τ = T*r / J
   - φ = T*L / (J*G)
3. Implemented data analysis in Python.
4. Plotted stress-strain curves and computed material constants.
